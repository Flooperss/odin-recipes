        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>Chicken Marinade</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - You’ll need boneless skinless chicken breasts and boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe. You could use just one or the other, but the recipe is so tasty with both.</li>
                    <li><strong>Buttermilk</strong> - Adds a lovely tang flavor and makes the chicken both tender and crispy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Salt</strong> - Used to season and bring out the natural flavor of the chicken.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spices</strong> - A perfectly balanced mixture of sweet paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, and white pepper is used to add flavor to the chicken.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Breading</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flour</strong> - Basic all-purpose flour is used to bread the fried chicken.</li>
                    <li><strong>Baking Powder and Baking Soda</strong> - Helps the breading to puff up a bit when fried and makes it crispy too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonings</strong> - Salt and black pepper are used to season the flour mixture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spices</strong> - Like the marinade, a similar mixture of sweet paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper plus some added dried oregano is used to make the breading extra tasty.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Honey Siracha Mayo</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mayonnaise</strong> - You can use any store-bought mayo or make your own homemade mayonnaise.</li>
                    <li><strong>Honey</strong> - Adds the perfect touch of sweetness to balance out the spicy mayo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pickle Juice</strong> - The acidic vinegar base of the pickle brine makes this sauce incredible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Siracha</strong> - It’s spicy and loaded with garlic. You can add more if you like or less if you want to make a more mild sauce for your sandwiches.</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Sandwhiches</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burger Buns</strong> - You can use any type of buns you like.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coleslaw</strong> - Adds some yummy freshness to the sandwich. You can pick some up at the store or use my easy coleslaw recipe.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pickles</strong> - No fried chicken sandwich would be complete without some sliced pickles.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Direrctions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Flatten The Chicken</h4><br>To begin, the chicken needs to be pounded thin before being marinated. The best way to do this is to put the pieces of chicken between 2 layers of plastic wrap and then use a meat mallet or rolling pin to beat them until they are about ¼ inch in thickness. However, be careful. You don’t want to tear the meat. </li>
                    <li><h4>Marinate The Chicken</h4><br>Next, we are going to infuse the chicken with some flavor, but first set the meat aside for a moment. Then mix all the other marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Now, add the chicken to the marinade and coat it well. Then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for at least an hour.</li>
                    <li><h4>Male The Sauce</h4><br>While the chicken is busy marinating in the fridge, you can make the honey sriracha mayo. To do this, just use a whisk to mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl. Then cover the sauce with some plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until ready to use.</li>
                    <li><h4>Prep The Chicken To Fry</h4><br>Once the chicken is done marinating, you can begin getting it ready to fry. First, combine all the breading ingredients together in a shallow bowl.<br>Then dredge each piece of chicken one at a time through the flour mixture and set it on a baking sheet with a wire rack on top. Be sure that you completely coat each piece.</li>
                    <li><h4>Heat The Oil</h4><br>Now you can begin heating about 2 to 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350°F (177°C) in a large skillet. You can also fry the chicken in a large pot or Dutch oven. However, if the oil begins to get too hot you need to turn the temperature down or off. You can then turn it back on once the oil cools off a bit. Using a digital cooking thermometer or candy thermometer is an easy way to keep an eye on the temperature of the hot oil. And while the oil is heating, place a wire cooling rack over a baking sheet lined with a bunch of paper towels.</li>
                    <li><h4>Fry The Chicken</h4><br>After the oil reaches the proper temperature, add one to two pieces of chicken at a time to the skillet and fry them for about 3 to 4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy. Be careful not to splash yourself with hot oil when flipping them over. You need to cook the chicken in batches. It’s important not to crowd the pan. Then transfer the cooked chicken to the wire rack and repeat the process with the other pieces of chicken.</li>
                    <li><h4>Assemble The Sandwiches</h4><br>Finally, let’s make some fried chicken sandwiches! To start, make sure the excess oil has drained from the chicken. Then spread your buns with a bit of the sriracha mayo. Then put a piece of fried chicken on the bottom bun. Now, add some coleslaw, pickles, and the top bun to finish! You can also toast your buns if you choose, I prefer mine toasted but it’s up to you.</li>
